    "text": "Southwest Fisheries Science Center initiated towed array research in the late 1990s using solid hydrophone arrays developed by Norris (Santa Barbara). Breakages at sea were common, and Jay Barlow began designing a custom towed hydrophone to provide more control over building and repairing equipment. The first towed hydrophones developed by SWFSC consisted of solid polyeurethane hydrophones molded onto cable (see Construction Guide). These solid hydrophones required a long and robust ‘tail’ to minimize ‘fish-tailing’, and yet damage to internal wires at the front end of the mold were common (this area acted as a ‘joint’, bending and eventually leading to wear on the internal wires). A need for more robust towed arrays with the ability to repair and replace internal components lead to the design of oil-filled towed hydrophone arrays (still in use today).\nLater, SWFSC conducted several efforts to develop a volumetric (tetrahedral) towed hydrophone array to allow for improved real-time localization. Initial efforts led by Jay Barlow led to successful tracking of beaked whales during SoCal Behavioral Response Studies (SoCal BRS), and later collaborations with external organizations via Small Business Innovation Research programs.\nUltimately, the need for real-time detection during surveys off the U.S. West Coast did not justify the resources required and SWFSC conducted their final towed array survey in 2016. All towed array equipment was transferred to other science centers still conducting towed array surveys, and ongoing improvement of towed array systems are being led by our colleagues at PIFSC.",

    "text": "Tracking animals will be done primarily through the click detector. Once you see a click train (3-5 consecutive clicks along the same bearing), start a detection in the Detection tab. Hit F1 to enter the time & date. Hit F1 to enter the Lat/long. Enter the Acoustic ID # along with at least the initial bearing angle. You can fill out the other fields as the event goes on. There are 3 Detection tabs so that you can track 3 things at once. You can also use the TD tab to localize whistles.\n\nFor encounters in which there are both bearings from the whistles and clicks, you can merge them into one event by going to the map, holding down CTRL + left click and select “Assign X bearings to UID#”. You should then see both the whistle and click bearings as the same color. You may need to repeat this step over the course of the encounter.\n\nA mark should be placed at the start position on the trackline of the initial bearing location- clicks don’t stay on the map for long, the markers will last longer. Double click the spot on the map to enter “start of A#- [species]”\nMeasuring the perpendicular distance from the ship’s track to the marked location can be done in the Map tab, by double-clicking next to the map comment and click + hold to the convergences (note: if you happen to select the pixel the map comment is on Pamguard won’t draw the measuring line). If you have R and L locations, measure on both sides of the ship’s track and take the average distance (this will be the beam distance). If you only have one location, take all measurements from the trackline to that location. Also measure the distance from the ship’s track along the first angle plotted that converged at the location (the first detection distance).\nCan you tie this detection to a visual sighting?? If so, be sure to record the visual ID, and any other info from the visual team in the comments field (time, bearing, distance, species ID, etc.).\n\nUse the Visual to Array Angle module and the incoming information from the flying bridge to do so\n\nFor marking the end of a detection, follow these general guidelines\n\nSperm whales: until 5 min have passed where no clicks are detected (can feel free to press F1 prior to this but keep the detection tab open for another 5 min)\nBeaked whales: get an end time when 1 minute has passed without clicks. You will probably need to press F1 a few times as the clicks come back (thus constantly updating the end time)\nDolphins: if it’s just clicks, the end time is within 30s of the last click train. If it’s whistles and clicks, keep the detection open for up to 2 min after the last whistle. It’s common for whistle presence to come in and out\n\nClick “Save” to save this detection to the database.\n\nIf you end the encounter prematurely, you can double click on the row below the form to make any changes. Note that the F1 features do not work in this view. If the encounter’s row is not visible, you can make a comment using an asterisk (*) in the User Input for later modification during the QAQC process.\n\nLook/listen for new groups. Continue to check bearings to sounds. Sometimes you will pick up a new group ahead of the ship while you are still hearing a group behind the ship.  Start a new Acoustic ID when another group is detected.  If a second group is detected before you have stored the info about the first group, you can save the first group and start a new group, then go back and edit the info for the 1st group when time allows.  Make note if long periods occur with no acoustic activity (i.e. “AQ”).\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD For further details, please refer to the [movie link- TBD]",

This is because beaked whales exhibit an acoustic response to echosounders thus we need to balance collecting passive acoustic information on beaked whales, with the need to collect prey layer data from the echosounder, which has been found to be a useful covariate in some species models. The survey technician on board is responsible for changing the echosounder state, however, it is your responsibility to VERIFY that the EK80 has been turned to passive mode based on the proposed schedule. If it has not, find the survey tech and kindly ask them to turn it off.\n If you cannot find the survey tech, contact the bridge and ask for them, if that doesn’t work:\n\nOn the Pisces, the EK80 controls are in the acoustics lab toward the galley. To change the status of the echosounder, select “Normal operation” button on the right. Under “Mode” select “Passive” for all echosounder rows. Click “Apply” and “Ok”.

New clicks come in at 20 degrees. These new clicks would belong to a new group\n\n\n\nFor the following fields, underline= required field\n\n\nStartTime Date: Start of detection (auto fill using F1, but correct the time to the initial click or whistle detected on the tracking computer) by either clicking on the click in the T-B plot and reading the time off the waveform, or hovering over the end of the bearing line drawn on the map\nEndTime Date: Last signal (click or whistle) detected (auto fill using F1, but correct the time to the last click or whistle detected on the tracking computer) using the same methodology as in 5.c.i\nLocation: Autofill with F1 within 2 minutes of start time\n\nIf there has been more than 2 minutes from the StartTime to filling in the field then place this comment in the Detection’s comment box (*Edit Lat/Lon to StartTime). If you’ve made a map comment for the start of the event, you can get that value in data QAQC (*see map comment for position of A1)\n\nAcoustic ID: Start with 1 at beginning of cruise and continue counting until end of the project (do NOT start over each Leg)\nVisual ID: Sighting ID number from Visual time that matches current detection\n\nIf never seen, leave blank\n\n\n\nInitial Angle: First angle detected from either a click or whistle\nInitial Distance: Location at start of localization\n\nIf never localized then fill in NA for units\n\nBeam Distance: Perpendicular distance from the beam (90 degrees) of the array to the first subgroup of animals\n\nWith timestamp\nIf never localized then fill in NA for units\n\nDetection Distance: Greatest distance animals were detected from the array. That can be the same as Initial or Beam distance.\n\nIf never localized then fill in NA for units\n\nLocalization Method: If any of the distances were measured then select Pamguard, otherwise NA.\nVocals detected: Select as many vocal types that were present at any point throughout the detection (order does not matter)\nDetection Type: Acoustics or Both. Never use Visual as an option for this field. All Visual only sightings can be recorded in the User input.\nFirst Detection: Acoustics, Visual, or Both (Whomever’s start time is earliest). \nMethod: Acoustic Technician\nSpecies Code 1: Select species acoustics detects and fill out 2 & 3 if needed.\nAdditional Method fields are to be filled out if Visuals has a species ID. They don’t have to match acoustics. Example: Visuals has Unid. beaked whale, but Acoustics detects Cuvier’s beaked whales. OR Visuals has sperm whales and Acoustics detects sperm whales & Unid. dolphins.\nComments: Any additional information of note from the detection. If the field is filled then add additional information in the User input. Add the UID number so we can match the PAMGuard annotations to the Acoustic ID later\n\nClick SAVE\n\nEffort\n\n\nFill out at every shift change and/or change in effort status\n\nStartTime Date: auto fill using F1\nCruise Number: e.g. PC2501\nTrackline ID: Leave empty if off the trackline, fill in the trackline number if on effort and on track\nAcousticians: Those present in the chairs. The first one is the person on effort, the second one is for the standby acoustician\nEffort\n\nAcoustic: ON when acousticians are monitoring the recordings\nVisual: ON when members of the Visual team are on the flying bridge (or bridge) regardless of their effort status. Make a comment if they are on weather watch (PIFSC surveys, for NEFSC the chief sci does this)\nRecording: ON when data is being collected\nOther effort: echosounder status (ON/OFF)\n\nReal-time Monitoring: Select the channels being monitored on the tracking computer\nSound speed: enter the soundspeed from the most recent bongo\nSea state: if an observer is in the dry lab ask them, otherwise determine it yourself\nLeave the rest blank\n\n\n\nClick SAVE\n\n\nSperm whale (NEFSC only)\n\n\nStart/End Time\nStart/End latitude and longitude\nID (46-Sperm Whale) and ID type (acoustic tech, visual, or both) \nCall type detected (Usual, Coda, etc)\nLocalization not required, but feel free to practice if clicks registering on detector and nothing else is happening (NEFSC only).  \nComments should contain a rough estimate of how many sperm whales are in the event\n\nPlayback (NEFSC only)\n1.

There is both an aural (sperm whales, some dolphin whistles and clicks), and visual component (spectrogram, click bearing-time display), data entry form, and incoming sightings information on a separate computer, so your attention needs to be diverted amongst multiple screens and incoming information.\n\nPlease keep in mind that while you will hear sperm whales and dolphin whistles, you often will not hear echolocation – the aural component is to reduce the stress of what to pay attention to on screen.\nSperm whale start/ends can be assessed aurally, and for dolphins, serve more as a cue.",
