    "text": "Tracking animals will be done primarily through the click detector. Once you see a click train (3-5 consecutive clicks along the same bearing), start a detection in the Detection tab. Hit F1 to enter the time & date. Hit F1 to enter the Lat/long. Enter the Acoustic ID # along with at least the initial bearing angle. You can fill out the other fields as the event goes on. There are 3 Detection tabs so that you can track 3 things at once. You can also use the TD tab to localize whistles.\n\nFor encounters in which there are both bearings from the whistles and clicks, you can merge them into one event by going to the map, holding down CTRL + left click and select “Assign X bearings to UID#”. You should then see both the whistle and click bearings as the same color. You may need to repeat this step over the course of the encounter.\n\nA mark should be placed at the start position on the trackline of the initial bearing location- clicks don’t stay on the map for long, the markers will last longer. Double click the spot on the map to enter “start of A#- [species]”\nMeasuring the perpendicular distance from the ship’s track to the marked location can be done in the Map tab, by double-clicking next to the map comment and click + hold to the convergences (note: if you happen to select the pixel the map comment is on Pamguard won’t draw the measuring line). If you have R and L locations, measure on both sides of the ship’s track and take the average distance (this will be the beam distance). If you only have one location, take all measurements from the trackline to that location. Also measure the distance from the ship’s track along the first angle plotted that converged at the location (the first detection distance).\nCan you tie this detection to a visual sighting?? If so, be sure to record the visual ID, and any other info from the visual team in the comments field (time, bearing, distance, species ID, etc.).\n\nUse the Visual to Array Angle module and the incoming information from the flying bridge to do so\n\nFor marking the end of a detection, follow these general guidelines\n\nSperm whales: until 5 min have passed where no clicks are detected (can feel free to press F1 prior to this but keep the detection tab open for another 5 min)\nBeaked whales: get an end time when 1 minute has passed without clicks. You will probably need to press F1 a few times as the clicks come back (thus constantly updating the end time)\nDolphins: if it’s just clicks, the end time is within 30s of the last click train. If it’s whistles and clicks, keep the detection open for up to 2 min after the last whistle. It’s common for whistle presence to come in and out\n\nClick “Save” to save this detection to the database.\n\nIf you end the encounter prematurely, you can double click on the row below the form to make any changes. Note that the F1 features do not work in this view. If the encounter’s row is not visible, you can make a comment using an asterisk (*) in the User Input for later modification during the QAQC process.\n\nLook/listen for new groups. Continue to check bearings to sounds. Sometimes you will pick up a new group ahead of the ship while you are still hearing a group behind the ship.  Start a new Acoustic ID when another group is detected.  If a second group is detected before you have stored the info about the first group, you can save the first group and start a new group, then go back and edit the info for the 1st group when time allows.  Make note if long periods occur with no acoustic activity (i.e. “AQ”).\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD For further details, please refer to the [movie link- TBD]",

This is because beaked whales exhibit an acoustic response to echosounders thus we need to balance collecting passive acoustic information on beaked whales, with the need to collect prey layer data from the echosounder, which has been found to be a useful covariate in some species models. The survey technician on board is responsible for changing the echosounder state, however, it is your responsibility to VERIFY that the EK80 has been turned to passive mode based on the proposed schedule. If it has not, find the survey tech and kindly ask them to turn it off.\n If you cannot find the survey tech, contact the bridge and ask for them, if that doesn’t work:\n\nOn the Pisces, the EK80 controls are in the acoustics lab toward the galley. To change the status of the echosounder, select “Normal operation” button on the right. Under “Mode” select “Passive” for all echosounder rows. Click “Apply” and “Ok”.

I find it easiest to find the bearing and keep repeating it to myself in my head. Then, I go over to logger form, and hit F1 for start time/date and then F1 for location and then type in the number I’ve been repeating in my head into the bearing box. If you forget it, you can use the small triangles of color that match your click train just outside the y-axis to provide a pretty good guideline of bearing. Placing your cursor along a similar line horizontally in the click detector window will show you the bearing reading at the top of the scrolling click detector. Sometimes I’m trigger happy and start an encounter that is indeed nothing of interest and then I just clear the form and leave it available for an actual encounter.

On the towed array, Echidna, the hydrophones can be a max of 2m apart if you use the one closest to the ship and the one furthest from the skip, skipping the middle hydrophone.

The peak frequency is the number that will be most useful to you. The peak frequency will help you categorize beaked whale clicks for example. Also, the shape of this click spectrum will help you categorize clicks into species.

A landscape map view will likely not show you the distances you are measuring, which appear directly above the map key in the bottom right hand corner. They are cut off when the map window shrinks vertically too much.\nDouble click on the trackline where you first detected an acoustic encounter. This opens a “map comment” pop up which you can then put text into. The tracklines and localization lines do not save in the map file. But the dots left behind as map comments do save and are connected with the GPS coordinates. I like to type in “start loc AIDXXX” where XXX is the number of your encounter or acoustic ID. For example, start loc AID37 or start loc AID568. Some use just the letter “A” for acoustic: A37 or A568. I like writing out AID since there is also a UID number that is associated with whistles.\nSimilarly, double clicking on the best localization is nice, so that that information is easily pulled up later in the lab via map comments dropped along the way.\n\nFor sperm whales, I rarely drop localization map comments, since this is more easily done in the lab after the cruise.\n\nFor locations that are obviously one side of the boat or the other because no lines are converging on one side, and they all converge nicely on the other, I will type: animal loc AIDXXX.\n\nIf visuals have seen these animals in that location, too, I will type “animal loc AIDXXX (visuals too)\n\nIf I can’t determine if it is on the left or right of the ship’s trackline, but I have decent convergence of lines, giving me a nice left location and a nice right location, I will leave two comments, one in each spot. I label these with the word “possible” as I don’t know if it’s on the right or the left. “possible animal loc (L) AIDXXX” or “possible animal loc (R) AIDXXX”\n\n\n\n\nSome colors that randomly are produced for localizations are hard to see on certain backgrounds. For example: yellow! If it bothers you, you can change the background. Display 🡪 color scheme Day, Night and Print are shown below. I tend to just power through the bad colors since no background seems to accept all colors nicely.\n\n\nScrolling with the wheel on the mouse is easier than the zoom in and out buttons, I think.\n\nClicking the measuring tool, lets you measure from one point to the next. It’s a little bit touchy, though. If you click on a pixel that already has information (a map comment, the ship track or a localization line), the starting point of the measurement won’t fix. You need to go just outside these other bits of information and drop your starting point in a clean spot on the map.",

    "text": "Whistle Detector Tab\nThis tab scrolls the live spectrogram and associated bearing panel. The right side of the screen is the newest sound info. The left side of the screen is the oldest sound info. You can set the screen to show any span of time. One minute is the most appropriate window size. It’s nice to have this window length match up with the click detector time length such that they are both scrolling at the same rate and it’s easier to match up localized clicks/whistles on their bearing and relative position in the time span displayed. But at times, you may want to shorten or lengthen the amount of time displayed.\nThe top black bar is bearing versusverses time. It shows the bearing in degrees relative to the ship. 90 degrees is at the ship line. It could be right or left (we have left and right ambiguity due to having only the two hydrophones slightly offset from each other, but on the same line). We’d need a slight change in course (5-1020 degrees one way or the other) to determine which side the animal is on. 0 degrees is dead ahead. 180 degrees is dead behind. These are also to one side or the other. Depth is something to figure out in the lab.\n\n\nNot many “tricks” for this window. Here are a few:\n\nClicks and whistles can show up here, but only whistles are detected and shown in the bearing display. Here are some non-whistle things you might see (and possibly hear) in the spectrogram display:\n\nSperm whales - Clicks, creaks, codas - all audible, unless distant\n\nRisso dolphin “exclamation mark” clicks - not audible – and, personally, I think hard to see\n\nDolphins – clicks, buzzes, bursts, pulses - all audible, unless distant\n\nAnthropogenic – ships, echosounders, ship maintenance noise - Distant ships, you may only see as a dark band along the bottom of the spectrogram, but it will become audible, if you get closer. Distant echosounders often confuse me until I look at the chart and figure out there is a ship nearby.\n\nEnvironmental – rain, wave noise - tends to be more wave noise in a Beaufort 6 or 7, obviously! - audible\n\n\nIf you click on a whistle to localize it, the frequency and bearing windows stop scrolling. You need to left click in the bearing window to “unfreeze” it such that it can scroll again.\n\nThe frequency range in our standard settings for viewing the spectrogram are set to 0-33kHz. The sound comes in decimated at a sample rate of 75kHz (as per our settings). There is a “flip” of the higher frequencies down onto the spectrogram (an “alias”). Imagine a landscape piece of paper which shows all the frequencies in the spectrogram. Then fold down the top 1/23 of the paper onto itself. Those frequencies can get “mirrored” down into the spectrogram. So, a 50kHz intense echosounder, for example, can reflect down into the viewed spectrogram, even though the y axis is only showing up to 33kHz. Since 50 is 17 higher than the max shown in the window (33), the top 17kHz in the spectrogram can show this sound. The “flip” point (or the fold in the paper) is at 37.5kHz (half of the decimated value of 75). The 50kHz echo will show up at 37.5-13 = 24.5. A confusing, unexplainable item showing up in the top of the spectrogram might be an aliased signal that is higher than you would think.\n\nIf you localize a whistle, but then decide it’s not what you want to localize or you accidentally assigned it to the wrong “color” or UID, you can right click on the same whistle and “remove” it from that UID, or reassign it to a different one.\n\nAdditional settings that are sometimes useful can be accessed by clicking some of the “settings” options on the windows themselves.",

The pressure in the oil will be the same as the water pressure (this is not true of solid-urethane hydrophones). Use a pressure transponder that measures pressure using a 4-20 milliamp scale (e.g. Keller model # PA7FLE ). When a voltage is applied to the positive wire, the current will be proportional to the depth. The current will be 4 mA at the surface and 20 mA at the maximum rated depth of the transponder (for example 20 Bar or approximately 200 m). You can use a 9v battery and a digital multimeter to measure this current. Because this device uses electronics, you cannot reverse the wires. The positive wire needs to be attached to the positive side of the battery. The current can be translated to depth using a simple formula.

This device measures voltage, not current. You can measure the voltage drop over a resistor to measure current if you put a 100 ohm resistor in series with the depth transponder (see figure). Ohm’s law says that the voltage drop (V) over a resistor is equal to the product of the resistance in ohms (R) and the current (I):\nV= I * R\nSo, with a 100 ohm resistor, voltage will be 100 times the current in amps. The equation for depth is therefore:\nDepth (m) = [voltage (V) * 125] - 50.\nThe Measurement Computing 1208LS can be used in single-ended (grounded) or differential mode. The latter measures the voltage difference between the two pins but does not ground one of the pins. This is less likely to introduce noise from the computer or the A/D device itself into the array cable. You can change this setting with the Instacalc software included with the 1208LS.

    "text": "The depth of an oil-filled array can be measured using a pressure transponder that is submersed in the oil. The pressure in the oil will be the same as the water pressure (this is not true of solid-urethane hydrophones). Use a pressure transponder that measures pressure using a 4-20 milliamp scale (e.g. Keller model # PA7FLE ). When a voltage is applied to the positive wire, the current will be proportional to the depth. The current will be 4 mA at the surface and 20 mA at the maximum rated depth of the transponder (for example 20 Bar or approximately 200 m). You can use a 9v battery and a digital multimeter to measure this current. Because this device uses electronics, you cannot reverse the wires. The positive wire needs to be attached to the positive side of the battery. The current can be translated to depth using a simple formula. For a 20 Bar transponder:\nDepth (m) = [current (mA) * 12.5] - 50.\nNotes: 200 m / 16  = 12.5 meters per mA (16 is the range of mA [20-4].\n            12.5 meters per mA * 4 = 50 (to account for not starting at 0 mA)\nTo display and record depth data on a computer, you need to use an Analog-to-Digital (A/D) converter (e.g. Measurement Computing model # USB-1208LS). This device measures voltage, not current. You can measure the voltage drop over a resistor to measure current if you put a 100 ohm resistor in series with the depth transponder (see figure). Ohm’s law says that the voltage drop (V) over a resistor is equal to the product of the resistance in ohms (R) and the current (I):\nV= I * R\nSo, with a 100 ohm resistor, voltage will be 100 times the current in amps. The equation for depth is therefore:\nDepth (m) = [voltage (V) * 125] - 50.\nThe Measurement Computing 1208LS can be used in single-ended (grounded) or differential mode.

    "text": "Southwest Fisheries Science Center initiated towed array research in the late 1990s using solid hydrophone arrays developed by Norris (Santa Barbara). Breakages at sea were common, and Jay Barlow began designing a custom towed hydrophone to provide more control over building and repairing equipment. The first towed hydrophones developed by SWFSC consisted of solid polyeurethane hydrophones molded onto cable (see Construction Guide). These solid hydrophones required a long and robust ‘tail’ to minimize ‘fish-tailing’, and yet damage to internal wires at the front end of the mold were common (this area acted as a ‘joint’, bending and eventually leading to wear on the internal wires). A need for more robust towed arrays with the ability to repair and replace internal components lead to the design of oil-filled towed hydrophone arrays (still in use today).\nLater, SWFSC conducted several efforts to develop a volumetric (tetrahedral) towed hydrophone array to allow for improved real-time localization. Initial efforts led by Jay Barlow led to successful tracking of beaked whales during SoCal Behavioral Response Studies (SoCal BRS), and later collaborations with external organizations via Small Business Innovation Research programs.\nUltimately, the need for real-time detection during surveys off the U.S. West Coast did not justify the resources required and SWFSC conducted their final towed array survey in 2016. All towed array equipment was transferred to other science centers still conducting towed array surveys, and ongoing improvement of towed array systems are being led by our colleagues at PIFSC.",
