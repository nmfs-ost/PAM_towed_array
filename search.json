    "text": "Southwest Fisheries Science Center initiated towed array research in the late 1990s using solid hydrophone arrays developed by Norris (Santa Barbara). Breakages at sea were common, and Jay Barlow began designing a custom towed hydrophone to provide more control over building and repairing equipment. The first towed hydrophones developed by SWFSC consisted of solid polyeurethane hydrophones molded onto cable (see Construction Guide). These solid hydrophones required a long and robust ‘tail’ to minimize ‘fish-tailing’, and yet damage to internal wires at the front end of the mold were common (this area acted as a ‘joint’, bending and eventually leading to wear on the internal wires). A need for more robust towed arrays with the ability to repair and replace internal components lead to the design of oil-filled towed hydrophone arrays (still in use today).\nLater, SWFSC conducted several efforts to develop a volumetric (tetrahedral) towed hydrophone array to allow for improved real-time localization. Initial efforts led by Jay Barlow led to successful tracking of beaked whales during SoCal Behavioral Response Studies (SoCal BRS), and later collaborations with external organizations via Small Business Innovation Research programs.\nUltimately, the need for real-time detection during surveys off the U.S. West Coast did not justify the resources required and SWFSC conducted their final towed array survey in 2016. All towed array equipment was transferred to other science centers still conducting towed array surveys, and ongoing improvement of towed array systems are being led by our colleagues at PIFSC.",
