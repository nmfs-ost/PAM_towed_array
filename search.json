    "text": "Southwest Fisheries Science Center initiated towed array research in the late 1990s using solid hydrophone arrays developed by Norris (Santa Barbara). Breakages at sea were common, and Jay Barlow began designing a custom towed hydrophone to provide more control over building and repairing equipment. The first towed hydrophones developed by SWFSC consisted of solid polyeurethane hydrophones molded onto cable (see Construction Guide). These solid hydrophones required a long and robust ‘tail’ to minimize ‘fish-tailing’, and yet damage to internal wires at the front end of the mold were common (this area acted as a ‘joint’, bending and eventually leading to wear on the internal wires). A need for more robust towed arrays with the ability to repair and replace internal components lead to the design of oil-filled towed hydrophone arrays (still in use today).\nLater, SWFSC conducted several efforts to develop a volumetric (tetrahedral) towed hydrophone array to allow for improved real-time localization. Initial efforts led by Jay Barlow led to successful tracking of beaked whales during SoCal Behavioral Response Studies (SoCal BRS), and later collaborations with external organizations via Small Business Innovation Research programs.\nUltimately, the need for real-time detection during surveys off the U.S. West Coast did not justify the resources required and SWFSC conducted their final towed array survey in 2016. All towed array equipment was transferred to other science centers still conducting towed array surveys, and ongoing improvement of towed array systems are being led by our colleagues at PIFSC.",

    "text": "The depth of an oil-filled array can be measured using a pressure transponder that is submersed in the oil. The pressure in the oil will be the same as the water pressure (this is not true of solid-urethane hydrophones). Use a pressure transponder that measures pressure using a 4-20 milliamp scale (e.g. Keller model # PA7FLE ). When a voltage is applied to the positive wire, the current will be proportional to the depth. The current will be 4 mA at the surface and 20 mA at the maximum rated depth of the transponder (for example 20 Bar or approximately 200 m). You can use a 9v battery and a digital multimeter to measure this current. Because this device uses electronics, you cannot reverse the wires. The positive wire needs to be attached to the positive side of the battery. The current can be translated to depth using a simple formula. For a 20 Bar transponder:\nDepth (m) = [current (mA) * 12.5] - 50.\nNotes: 200 m / 16  = 12.5 meters per mA (16 is the range of mA [20-4].\n            12.5 meters per mA * 4 = 50 (to account for not starting at 0 mA)\nTo display and record depth data on a computer, you need to use an Analog-to-Digital (A/D) converter (e.g. Measurement Computing model # USB-1208LS). This device measures voltage, not current. You can measure the voltage drop over a resistor to measure current if you put a 100 ohm resistor in series with the depth transponder (see figure). Ohm’s law says that the voltage drop (V) over a resistor is equal to the product of the resistance in ohms (R) and the current (I):\nV= I * R\nSo, with a 100 ohm resistor, voltage will be 100 times the current in amps. The equation for depth is therefore:\nDepth (m) = [voltage (V) * 125] - 50.\nThe Measurement Computing 1208LS can be used in single-ended (grounded) or differential mode. The latter measures the voltage difference between the two pins but does not ground one of the pins. This is less likely to introduce noise from the computer or the A/D device itself into the array cable. You can change this setting with the Instacalc software included with the 1208LS. You can also set the voltage range to give the best resolution using PamGuard’s depth setup window or Logger’s database. Voltage across the resistor will not exceed 2 volts, so you can chose the +/- 2.5V scale.\n\n\n\nThe depth of an oil-filled array can be measured using a pressure transponder that is submersed in the oil.
